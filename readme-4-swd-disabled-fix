when swd pins are disabled in firmware, flasher and debugger won't be able 
to connect to the device to update it further or to debug. 

segger suggests to place a delay at the beginning to give emulator a gap 
to put the processor to a halt. 

to fix without the initial delay:
jump the cs pin on spi flash to ground throug a small resistor. 
download a new firmware from a flasher. 
when the console or the flasher shows it is downloading, remove the jumper. 
when it is done, a corrupt image will be flashed. 
reboot with the corrupt image, it won't be able to execute previous firmware. 
now, flash a new image as usual. 


log snippet shows when cs tied to ground and when booting a corrupt image:
when downloading was seen the jumper was removed.
